Install NodeJS before you do any of this
Also learn some Javascript (https://discordjs.guide/#before-you-begin)

Go to the config.json file

```json
{
    "token": "TOKEN_HERE", // https://discordapi.com/
    "mongo_url": "(OPTIONAL)", // https://mongodb.com/
    "prefix": "PREFIX" // prefixs like: /, $, or anything of your liking
}
```

Next you install discord.js (npm i discord.js) (https://discordjs.guide/commando/)

npm i discordjs/Commando (command handler, install git in order to use this)

I can't think of anything else here i guess
